\title{benchmark_cor Function: Compares the correlation structures between two datasets}
\usage{
benchmark_cor(data_model, df)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_model}{A list containing metadata for the original dataset, including the converted data (\code{data_converted}).}

\item{df}{A dataset to compare against the original dataset, typically a synthetic or altered version.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value. It generates a heatmap displaying the correlation differences between the two datasets,
along with Frobenius norm, Wasserstein distance, and logistic AUC values as text annotations.
}
\description{
This function compares the correlation structures of two datasets by computing the correlation matrices and visualizing their differences.
It calculates the Frobenius norm difference, Wasserstein distance, logistic AUC, and the absolute correlation differences,
visualizing them in a heatmap with statistical summaries.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Frobenius norm}: Measures the difference between the correlation matrices using a matrix norm.
\item \strong{Wasserstein distance}: A measure of the distance between the joint distributions of the two datasets.
\item \strong{Logistic AUC}: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the logistic regression model used to compare the datasets.
\item \strong{Heatmap}: Displays the absolute difference between the correlation matrices, with statistics overlaid.
